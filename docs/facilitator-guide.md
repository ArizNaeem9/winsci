# Facilitator Guide

## Teaching Principles
- Limit new concepts: 1â€“2 per lesson.
- Model thinking aloud; celebrate mistakes.
- Vary modalities: talk, demo, hands-on, reflection.

## Roles
- Facilitator: leads, demos, checks understanding.
- Helper: circulates, unblocks, encourages.

## Troubleshooting
- If devices are slow, pair learners and rotate.
- If internet fails, use local copies of slides/quizzes.
- If someone is stuck: ask them to explain what they tried, then suggest one next step.
