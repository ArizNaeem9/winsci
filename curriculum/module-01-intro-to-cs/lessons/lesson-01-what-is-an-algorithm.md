# Lesson 1 â€” What is an Algorithm?

## Objectives
- Define an algorithm
- Write and debug a simple step-by-step process

## Materials
- Slides: `lessons/slides/session-1-intro-to-cs.md` (export to PDF)
- Worksheet: `lessons/worksheets/intro-algorithms-worksheet.md`
- Quiz: `tools/simple-quiz/?bank=cs`

## Plan
- Hook: "Make a PB&J" algorithm on the board
- Concept: algorithm vs. code; inputs/outputs; ambiguity
- Guided: write steps; facilitator "executes" literally and reveals ambiguities
- Solo/Pair: refine steps to be unambiguous
- Reflect: share one improved step
- Exit ticket: define "algorithm" in one sentence

## Assessment
- Worksheet section 3 checked for clarity and sequencing
