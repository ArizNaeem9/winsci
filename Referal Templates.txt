Cover Letter Generation Template:
"Consider me a Rice University undergraduate student applying for a Software Engineering internship at <x> company. My goal is to create a unique, deeply personalized cover letter that blends my own experiences, technical skills, and values with <x>’s mission, culture, and products. When drafting the cover letter, you should:

Open with a memorable, story-driven hook that connects my background (Rice projects, internships, leadership, or personal initiatives) to something meaningful about <x> (its mission, flagship product, or engineering culture).

Highlight my technical skills (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, CI/CD, GPT-powered features, etc.) with quantified impact (metrics like performance gains, latency reduction, user adoption) and show how they are directly relevant to <x>’s challenges and priorities.

Weave in my extracurriculars and initiatives (Winsci, sustainability efforts, global perspective across Pakistan/U.S., teaching students with disabilities, transforming neglected spaces into gardens, etc.) to demonstrate creativity, leadership, and community impact beyond pure coding.

Demonstrate genuine knowledge of <x> by referencing specific technologies, initiatives, or company values, and make it clear why I’m excited to grow there.

Conclude with a forward-looking note that ties back to the opening theme (for example, “the aroma of clay” or personal experiences of resilience, innovation, or environmental stewardship), while expressing enthusiasm for contributing to <x> as a SWE intern.

Ensure the cover letter is one page, professional yet personal, avoids clichés, and makes me stand out as a candidate who brings both strong engineering ability and a unique human story."
