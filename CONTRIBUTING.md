Thanks for your interest! We welcome fixes, new lesson content, quizzes, translations, and accessibility reviews.

## Quick Start
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Keep PRs focused (≤ 300 lines), with a short demo (gif/screenshot) for UI/lesson changes.
3. Add/update docs and tests where applicable.
4. Follow the style guide: simple language, short sections, runnable examples.

## Content Style
- Use plain English. Avoid jargon unless defined in a callout.
- Keep lessons 45–60 min and modules 2–4 sessions.
- Provide an objective, materials list, and exit ticket.
- Accessible by default: ≥14px fonts, high contrast, keyboard navigable.

## File Naming
- `lessons/slides/session-<number>-<topic>.pdf`
- `lessons/worksheets/<topic>-worksheet.md`
- `curriculum/module-XX-<name>/lessons/lesson-XX-<name>.md`

## Licensing
- Code: MIT. Educational content: state license at top (MIT by default).
